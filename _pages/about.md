Hi! I’m Tianxiang Wu.
My research interests focus on **knowledge-enhanced LLMs**, **LLM Reasoning**, **LLM Agent** and the broader foundations of intelligent and interpretable AI systems.
I’m pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I’ve maintained a 4.0 GPA across advanced coursework in algorithms, machine learning, and data systems.
Beyond classes, I’ve participated in and led multiple research projects that strengthened my passion for building principled and creative AI systems.
